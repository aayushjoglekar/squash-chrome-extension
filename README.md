# squash-chrome-extension
Squash is a chrome extension which serves as a panic button. It will close all the tabs in the current window, save the URLs and open a set of predefined URLs by the user. The saved URLs can be restored later.

Incase the shortcuts are not working, go to chrome://extensions and **enable the extension**. This is done by chrome for safety purposes.
